# Hybrid Serverless Agent Demo

The purpose of this React app is to demo Hybrid Serverless Agent.

## Demo Steps

### Disable CORS

Assuming you have deployed this repo locally, you need to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) from your browser. This will allow your browser to make requests to a domain different from the domain that the app is hosted on (e.g., localhost).

To allow CORS with Chrome on Mac, open up a Terminal window and run:

```
open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security

```
